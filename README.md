# SMS-simple-48kB-cartridge
Master System repro 48kB, in DIP and PLCC format

Hi, here a simple 48kb cartridge ready to produce

2 versions, DIP (through hole, easy to solder) and PLCC
BRD files for Eagle, Kicad users or by Oshpark manufacturer.

Gerbers files are made for JLC,
but are certainly compatible with others manufacturers
(files are Â± standard)
1. Go on https://jlcpcb.com
2. Use Instant Quote button
3. Upload the ZIP file containing gerber files
4. Choose how many boards, color and finition

PCB Qty : Choose your quantity
PCB Thickness : 1.6mm
PCB Color : Choose your color, but can impact the price when finition is not HASL (with lead)
Surface Finish : Chose the finition, HASL is tin (basic) and ENIG is gold (best)
Mark on PCB : Order number (specify position) (will be under the component)

Components

for DIP pcb
* 1x SST39SF010 (128k flash) or compatible DIP 32 -compare pinout !-
* 1x 74LS00 or 74HCT00 DIP (DIL14)
* 1x polarized capacitor 10, 22 or 47uF, 16v, 2.54mm
* 2x ceramic capacitors 100nf, 50v, 5mm

for PLCC pcb
* 1x SST39SF010 (128k flash) or compatible PLCC -compare pinout !-
* 1x 74LS00 or 74HCT00 SOIC (SO14)
* 1x tantalum (or ceramic) capacitor 10, 22 or 47uF, 10v to 50v, 1632 or 3216
* 2x ceramic capacitors 100nf, 50v, 0603
- for an easy soldering, buy/use a stencil + solder paste.
PLCC packages are not really made for hand soldering.

Why flash component ?
because originally, my pcb are (re)writable with my SMSdumper.
